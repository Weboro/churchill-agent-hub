Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of this Policy is to clearly state the Churchill Institute of Higher Education’s (‘the Institute’) Policy on academic integrity which applies to its students. This Policy document must be read in conjunction with the Student Code of Conduct.<h3>2. Background</h3><p>Academic integrity and honesty are fundamental principles of any educational institute devoted to the pursuit of excellence in teaching and learning. The Institute is committed to maintaining the highest academic standards and will:<ul><li>Instill in students the importance of independent thought, carrying out their own research and knowing how to acknowledge the work of others;<li>Require and expect students to undertake their academic work honestly and to conduct themselves in a manner which is and consistent with the principles of academic integrity;<li>Use a range of approaches to raise awareness by students about the critical importance of academic integrity and to educate students to practice academic honesty in the creation, development, and application of their work;<li>Act in a consistent and equitable manner to access and manage any academic misconduct by students.</ul><h3>3. Definitions</h3><p>For definitions, refer to the Dictionary of Terms.<h2>Scope</h2><p>This Policy applies to all students enrolled in the Institute in relation to the creation, development, and application of all academic assessments.<h2>Policy Statement</h2><p>The Institute will ensure that academic integrity is managed by fair, timely and transparent procedures, based on clearly defined, consistent and equitable criteria. Failure to maintain academic integrity will be dealt with seriously and appropriate action taken.<h2>Preventative Measure</h2><p>The Institute adopts preventative strategies that mitigate the risk of academic misconduct which applies equally to all students and staff of the Institute. Academic Integrity is promoted at orientation and within the classroom by:<ul><li>Conducting ‘Academic Integrity Workshops’ – the Librarian and Learning Support Manager will conduct such workshops at least 6 times during each teaching term;<li>Role modelling academic integrity to students;<li>Clearly communicating assessment/examination requirements to students;<li>Encouraging students to make every effort to avoid academic misconduct by taking responsibility for understanding what constitutes academic misconduct and assessment/examination requirements through attendance of the workshop involved.</ul><h2>Elements of Academic Integrity</h2><p>Academic misconduct/misdemeanour at the Institute is inclusive but not limited to the following, students must not intend to deceive under any assessment tasks.<h3>5.1 Cheating in Examination</h3><p>In attempting any examination, the student(s) must not:<ul><li>Read, copy from, or otherwise using another student's work during an exam or knowingly allow another student to do so;<li>Acquire, attempt, possess, or distribute examination materials or information without any pre-approval;<li>Accept assistance from any person/source who is not an examination supervisor whilst in the examination room;<li>Consult with another source outside the examination room during the examination process;<li>Impersonate another source or procure impersonation in attempting the examination.</ul><h3>5.2 Plagiarism</h3><p>Plagiarism occurs when the student(s) present their thoughts, ideas, or work of another source without proper acknowledgement of the author or the source. Students must not:<ul><li>Partly or significantly copy ideas, concepts, text, data, and information from another source and present it as his or her own work;<li>Construct content which is drawn from any source without attribution of the source;<li>Summarise another person’s work without acknowledgement of the source;<li>Submit substantially the same final version of any material as another student.</ul><p>Therefore, in presenting a written assignment, the students should make it clear when a direct quotation is used, and in the case of using resources to build an argument, an acknowledgement of the resources should be made by using the appropriate method of referencing.<h3>5.3 Collusion</h3><p>In the event of assessment, in which individually assessable work is required to be submitted, the formulation of ideas must be the independent work of each student. Therefore, the student must not:<ul><li>Undertake unauthorised collaboration in which students work together to produce an identical assessment, either in part or in whole;<li>Encourage or assist another person to commit collusion by allowing the person to copy their work for completing an assessment.</ul><h3>5.4 Recycling assignment</h3><p>The Institute expects students not to submit an assessment that is an identical or a substantially similar assessment for another or previously submitted unit. The Institute understands that academic work within a discipline could be interrelated and expects students, when transcribing content for use in similar topics, to enhance and refine the content of an assignment as they progress through their degree. It is not acceptable to resubmit the exact copy of work previously submitted without enhancing or refining the concepts contained in the assignment.<h3>5.5 Contract Cheating</h3><p>Students must not:<ul><li>Contract a third party for a fee or another benefit (e.g., free of cost) to complete part or all the assessment on behalf of the student;<li>Submit part or all the assessment as his or her own when it was completed by a third party.</ul><h3>5.6 Misrepresentation or Fabrication of Data</h3><p>Students must not:<ul><li>Fabricate or falsify data and then present it as legitimate data in an assessment.</ul><h2>Identifying and Detecting Academic Misconduct</h2><p>Academic misconduct may be identified by:<ul><li>Plagiarism detection software;<li>Unit Coordinator/Marker/Tutor or Examination invigilator/Marker;<li>Report from another student.</ul><h2>Whistleblowers – Breach and Protection</h2><p>Where a breach of academic integrity is reported, the person reporting the breach (whistleblower) will be protected from any backlash and treated with sensitivity and respect. The whistleblower will be expected to act honestly and make the report in good faith. If the report is found to be made with malicious intent, appropriate action may be taken against the whistleblower. The Institute will ensure that the whistleblower’s identity is kept confidential unless disclosure is required by law or necessary to ensure a fair process. Whistleblowers can report breaches through the designated channels provided by the Institute.<h2>Level of Academic Misconduct</h2><p>The level of academic misconduct will be classified as either minor or major depending on the severity and frequency of the misconduct.<h3>8.1 Minor Misconduct</h3><p>Minor misconduct includes, but is not limited to:<ul><li>Unintentional failure to acknowledge sources;<li>First-time offense;<li>Small portion of work affected.</ul><p>Minor misconduct may result in penalties such as a warning, reduced marks, or requirement to resubmit the work with proper acknowledgment.<h3>8.2 Major Misconduct</h3><p>Major misconduct includes, but is not limited to:<ul><li>Intentional plagiarism;<li>Repeated offenses;<li>Large portion of work affected;<li>Cheating in examinations;<li>Contract cheating;<li>Fabrication or falsification of data.</ul><p>Major misconduct may result in more severe penalties such as failing the unit, suspension, or expulsion from the Institute.<h2>Penalties</h2><p>The penalties for academic misconduct will be applied based on the level of misconduct and may include:<ul><li>Warning;<li>Reduced marks;<li>Requirement to resubmit work;<li>Failing the unit;<li>Suspension from the Institute;<li>Expulsion from the Institute.</ul><p>Penalties will be determined by the Academic Integrity Committee in consultation with the relevant academic staff.<h2>Misconduct in Examinations</h2><p>Specific procedures are in place to address misconduct in examinations, including the confiscation of unauthorized materials, removal from the examination room, and further investigation by the Academic Integrity Committee.<h2>Appeals</h2><p>Students have the right to appeal decisions related to academic misconduct. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Academic Integrity Committee within a specified time frame, typically within 10 working days of the decision. The appeal process will be fair and transparent, providing the student with an opportunity to present their case.",

Preamble</h3><h4>1.1 Purpose</h4><p>The Course Progression and Graduation Policy (‘the Policy’) of Churchill Institute of Higher Education (‘the Institute’) includes guidance for monitoring the progress and attendance of international students, as well as reporting unsatisfactory course progress and attendance. The Policy identifies attendance requirements for international students, when an appropriate extension of the duration of the course is allowed and the obligation of the student to contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs (DHA) should there be any alteration in the duration of their course that could impact their visa status.<h4>1.2 Background</h4><p>The Policy outlines the Institute’s obligations to comply with ESOS Act and the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (‘National Code 2018’) in accordance with Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) registration requirements to safeguard the integrity of Australian migration laws by supporting international students in fulfilling their student visa requirements to complete their course within the required duration, as well as meeting the requirements for progress and attendance of the course. This includes monitoring and reporting on Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISM), rules for meeting course completion requirements, grounds for exclusion related to lack of satisfactory academic progress, and confirmation of student course completion and eligibility to graduate.<h4>1.3 Definitions</h4><p>For definitions, refer to the Dictionary of Terms.<h3 id=scope>2. Scope</h3><p>This Policy applies to all students enrolled in the Institute.<h3 id=policy-statement>3. Policy Statement</h3><p>Students are expected to progress through their course as per allowed time frame (3 year full time) and to maintain a satisfactory academic standard. The Institute will monitor, record and assess the course progress of each student for the course in which they are enrolled.<h3 id=course-progression-policy>4. Course Progression Policy</h3><p>Once students enroll in a course of study at the Institute, their progression through to graduation will be dependent upon meeting the minimum requirement of the course as set out in this Policy, and if necessary, academic intervention will take place upon review of the student's academic progression.<h4>4.1 Early Intervention – Students at Risk of Inadequate Academic Progress</h4><p>The Institute considers that satisfactory attendance in all unit learning activities and attempting all compulsory assessment events is critical to students’ academic success. The Institute will track student course progress throughout their study through systematic monitoring of their attendance at learning activities and their results of formal assessment tasks within the course that they are enrolled in.<p>4.1.1 The initial identification of students at potential risk of inadequate academic progress is the responsibility of the unit lecturer. Compulsory attendance records of student’s attendance at all compulsory learning activities will be maintained by each unit lecturer. After the first assessment event in a unit (or the conclusion of week five of the teaching period if no assessment event has occurred), the unit lecturer will identify any student enrolled in their unit that they consider to be potentially ‘at risk’ of inadequate academic progress. A unit lecturer should classify a student as potentially at risk when the unit lecturer identifies that the student has:<ul><li>a. not attended at least 80% of compulsory learning activities (e.g. lectures and/or tutorials); or<li>b. not attempted, or attempted but performed inadequately, in any assessment task. A grade of less than 50% in any assessment task will be considered a signal of inadequate performance in an assessment task.</ul><p>4.1.2 The Unit Lecturer will write an “Initial Letter of Concern Regarding Academic Progress” to each student enrolled in their unit they identified as potentially “at risk.” The letter will advise the student of the Unit Lecturer’s concern, remind them of their academic progress responsibilities and invite the student to contact the Unit Lecturer to discuss additional learning support. A student counselling session will also be offered if the student identifies their inadequate progress is a result of non-academic related issues.<p>4.1.3 Where the student fails to contact the Unit Lecturer within 10 working days of receipt of the “Initial Letter of Concern” or fails to address the factors that have been identified as affecting their academic progress, the Unit Lecturer will immediately advise the Course Coordinator who will issue the student with a “Second Letter of Concern Regarding Academic Progress.” This letter will advise the student of their classification as a “student at risk” and request the student attend a meeting with the Course Coordinator and Student Counsellor within 10 working days of receipt of the letter to arrange an academic counselling session.<p>4.2 During the academic counselling session, the Course Coordinator, Student Counsellor, and the student will determine what support is appropriate. This may include, but is not limited to:<ul><li>a. The student attending Academic Support Sessions;<li>b. The student receiving individual case management from the Student Counsellor;<li>c. The student receiving assistance with personal issues which are influencing academic progress;<li>d. The student receiving mentoring from senior students at the Institute;<li>e. A reduction in the student’s study load; or<li>f. A combination of the above.</ul><p>4.3 During the academic counselling sessions, the student will also be advised that continued failure to meet minimum academic standards could lead to conditions being placed on enrolment and/or to enrolment being terminated.<p>4.4 A record of the academic counselling session and any additional support to be provided will be documented in a “Learning Support Plan” which is signed by the Course Coordinator, Student Counsellor and the student and placed on the student’s file. The Course Coordinator is responsible for tracking the support being provided by the Institute and the student’s compliance with the agreed Learning Support Plan.<p>4.5 Where the student either fails to respond to the Course Coordinator’s request for an academic counselling session or fails to comply with the Learning Support Plan, the Course Coordinator will immediately notify the Dean. The Dean will issue the student with a letter of “Notice of Intention to Cancel Enrolment” and request the student attend a meeting with the Dean and the Course Coordinator within seven working days to discuss the Institute’s concerns with the student’s academic progress. As a result of that meeting the Dean may:<ul><li>i. prescribe the student undertake an alternative Learning Support Plan;<li>ii. approve a reduction of the student’s study load;<li>iii. place probationary provisions on the student;<li>iv. commence the process of terminating the student’s enrolment (refer Section 4.11).</ul><h4>4.6 Monitoring course progression at the end of each teaching period</h4><p>a. All students are required to meet minimum course progression standards. The Institute will monitor, assess and record the academic performance of students against the minimum academic standard as set out in this Policy. The monitoring process will take place at the end of each study period and will include the result for all units in the relevant study period. Students who are awarded more than one supplementary or deferred exam or who have unfinalised grades will not be included in the monitoring process until their grades are finalised.<p>b. Students will be considered as not meeting the Institute’s minimum course progression standards if they:<ul><li>i. fail a unit more than once; or<li>ii. fail 50% or more of the units attempted in a semester.</ul><p>c. The Course Coordinator will monitor the academic performance of students against the minimum course progression standards by reviewing each student’s grades awarded at the end of each teaching term. After ratification of each semester’s results by the Academic Board and publication of results, the Course Coordinator will compile a course progression report for Academic Board within five (5) days. That report will list each enrolled student’s results to date and their academic status determined in accordance with Section 4.7 of this Policy.<h4>4.7 Academic Status</h4><p>a. Upon monitoring and reviewing a student’s academic progress, and based on a student’s academic performance, academic status will be granted with the following classification:<ul><li>• Good standing – the student's academic performance in the most recent teaching period is satisfactory.<li>• At risk – the student is identified as needing to take steps immediately to improve academic performance to make satisfactory progress in the future teaching period.<li>• On probation – the student identified as not making satisfactory progress performance and who will be required to engage in an intervention plan to improve his or her academic performance.</ul><h4>4.8 Failure to make satisfactory Academic Progress</h4><p>a. A student who fails to comply with the progression rules and fails to achieve minimum academic standards will be put in the category of either at risk, or on probation.<p>b. Depending on the Academic Status, the students who do not make satisfactory academic progress are expected to take responsibility for improving their academic performance in the next teaching period.<p>c. Students with ‘at risk’ academic status will be given a warning of the possible consequences of failing to meet the minimum academic standards and encouraged to seek academic help to improve their performance.<p>d. Students with ‘on probation’ academic status will be given support to improve their academic performance through an academic intervention program and required to meet extra conditions in the next teaching period.<p>e. Support for students with an “at risk” or “on probation” academic status will be determined by the Dean and Course Coordinator in accordance with paragraphs 4.2 to 4.4 of this policy. Monitoring of students deemed ‘at risk” or “on probation” will be overseen by the relevant Course Coordinator reporting to the Dean.<h4>4.9 Maximum time to complete the course</h4><p>a. Students must meet the requirements of a course within a prescribed number of years from the date of first enrolment. The rationale for placing a timeframe on course completion is to ensure that the qualification awarded reflects currency of knowledge and skill.<p>b. The maximum period of candidature for Bachelor of Business course (total 24 units) at the Institute is six (6) years. The time elapsed will be calculated from the date that a student commenced their first semester of study. In exceptional circumstances, the Dean may approve an extension of a further two (2) years to a maximum candidature of eight (8) years. International students are only permitted to apply for an extension of course duration with supporting evidence where:<ul><li>i. compassionate or compelling circumstances exist, including (but not limited to):</li><ul><li>• serious physical or mental illness, sickness, misadventure or other circumstances beyond a student’s control which may:<li>• prevent completion of a unit requirement,<li>• prevent attendance at an assessable activity,<li>• prevent submission of assessable work for a unit,<li>• significantly affect performance in any graded assessments. loss or bereavement, such as death of a close family member, family/relationship breakdown.<li>• hardship/trauma, such as victim of crime, sudden loss of income or employment or severe disruption to domestic arrangements; or</ul><li>ii. CHIE has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, an intervention strategy because the student is at risk of not meeting course progress requirements; or<li>iii. CHIE has previously approved a deferral or suspension of the student’s enrolment. Documented evidence will be required to support the application.</ul><p>c. Students who fail to complete course requirements within the specified frame will have their enrolment terminated and a statement noting that the maximum period of candidature has been exceeded will appear on the final academic transcript issued to the student.<p>d. Prior to termination students will be advised in writing by the Dean of the decision to terminate their enrolment and will also be advised that they have twenty (20) days from receiving notification of the decision to terminate their enrolment to appeal the decision.<h4>4.10 Procedure for Course Extension</h4><p>The course extension process includes the following procedures<ul><li>a. Submission of Course Extension request If an international student's visa expires early and they still have units to complete, they will need to submit an application to the institution to extend their COE and apply to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) for a new student visa.<li>b. Extension request assessment, reporting and outcome The extension to course duration request is assessed as per the guidelines explained in this Policy. As per National Code 2018, Standard 8, requests for an extension to course duration from an international student can only be approved for compassionate or compelling circumstances with supporting documentary evidence.<li>c. Appealing the outcome In compliance with the Complaints and Appeals Policy and Procedures, students have the right to lodge a complaint about a decision resulting in their application for an extension to their course duration being rejected.<li>d. Recording Extensions to course duration are recorded accordingly and reported on PRISMS.</ul><h4>4.11 Students who Continue to Fail to Meet Satisfactory Course Progress</h4><p>a. A student with an “at risk” or “on probation” academic classification will be deemed to have not met satisfactory course progress at the time they either:<ul><li>i. fail to respond within seven days of the request contained in the Dean’s “Notice of Intention to Cancel Enrolment” as stipulated in Section 4.5 of this policy;<li>ii. fail to meet a condition or obligation agreed to in an academic intervention plan as prescribed in Section 4.8 d of this policy;<li>iii. continue to fail to meet the minimum course progression standards contained in section 4.6b.</ul><p>b. A student who fails to complete their program of study within the maximum time (Section 4.9b) will be deemed to have not met satisfactory progress at the date of expiration of the maximum period from their enrolment in the course or the expiration of any approved date of course extension.<p>c. On determination that a student has continued to fail to meet satisfactory course progress the Dean will issue the student with a written Notice of Intention to Cancel Enrolment. This notice will also advise the student that they have twenty (20) days from receiving notification of the decision to terminate their enrolment to appeal the decision. Any such appeal will be assessed in accordance with Section 8 of this policy.<h3 id=aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people>5. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People</h3><p>CIHE students with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background might require special attention and support for academic success, will be identified early in their study at the Institute.<p>5.1 The Course Coordinator will prepare and present a report about the identified students to the Academic Board at least twice a year.<p>5.2 The Course Coordinator report about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander will, as a minimum, include the following aspects of their study:<ul><li>a. Number of students enrolled in each course/major;<li>b. Enrolment status – part or fulltime;<li>c. Academic progress in current semester and in the course;<li>d. Special support arrangement made for those students.</ul><p>5.3 The Academic Board will consider the Course Coordinator report on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background and those belonging to other subgroups and advise corrective action, if required.<h3 id=attendance>6. Attendance</h3><p>6.1 International students must maintain an attendance rate of 80%. Attendance is monitored and recorded by teaching and learning staff. Students whose attendance falls below 80% will be contacted by the Institute.<p>6.2 Record Keeping Records of all correspondence, notifications, meeting outcomes and action plans must be kept for international students at risk of unsatisfactory course progress status and for international students who fail to meet satisfactory course progression and/or course attendance requirements.<p>6.3 The Institute will keep all such records for two (2) years after the international student ceases to be a student of the Institute.<h3 id=graduation>7. Graduation</h3><h4>7.1 Eligibility to Graduate</h4><p>a. A student is eligible to graduate and receive a qualification testamur if:<ul><li>i. they meet all course requirements;<li>ii. they have no outstanding fees;<li>iii. there are no current suspension, exclusion or penalty on the student’s record; and<li>iv. they have not already graduated from that course.</ul><p>b.

Preamble</h3><h4>1.1 Purpose</h4><p>The Advanced Standing Policy and Procedure outlines the procedure involved in granting any advanced standing or credit transfer to students who would like to enrol into Churchill Institute of Higher Education (‘the Institute’) or transferring between course/units within the Institute.<h4>1.2 Background</h4><p>Students who have previously completed a recognised qualification from an accredited institution related to courses/units that the student is enrolling into, can apply for advanced standing at the Institute. The Institute also recognises previous study from other education providers which may have articulation agreements in place with the Institute.<p>The previous study could have been from a university, other higher education provider, TAFE or registered training organisation in Australia and/or a recognised international educational institution. The decision to grant Advanced Standing takes into consideration that the student will be able to commence study without “undue” difficulty and ensures that there is minimal impact to the future learning experience.<h4>1.3 Definitions</h4><p>For definitions, please refer to the Dictionary of Terms.<h3 id=scope>2. Scope</h3><p>This policy and its procedures apply to all courses/units offered at the Institute. The Advanced Standing that is granted in accordance with this document does not guarantee a place in a course.<h3 id=policy-statement>3. Policy Statement</h3><p>The Institute will ensure that all applications of Advanced Standing and credit transfer are processed in a timely and fair manner following the Institute’s overall objectives.<h3 id=principles>4.

Preamble</h3><h4>1.1 Purpose</h4><p>The purpose of the Assessment Moderation Policy is to outline the Churchill Institute of Higher Education’s (‘the Institute’) Policy on moderation of the assessments on its offered course(s).<h4>1.2 Background</h4><p>Assessment Moderation is an integral part of the assessment process at the Institute. It is designed to facilitate ongoing quality assurance and ensure that the original assessments are authentic and aligned to the Course and Unit Learning Outcomes. This Policy is designed to meet the requirements of the Academic Board’s approved policies, quality assurance standards, accreditation requirements and relevant administrative standards and to ensure that the Assessment Policy is fully applied.<h4>1.3 Definition</h4><p>For definitions, please refer to Dictionary of Terms.<h3 id=scope>2. Scope</h3><p>This policy provides information about the Institute’s policies and procedures for the moderation of all assessments of the courses offered. Furthermore, this policy applies to:<ul><li>a. the moderation of all assessments, including examination of coursework by students undertaking undergraduate award degrees at the institute<li>b. academic and administrative staff and people contracted by the Institute with responsibility for designing, administering, and making decisions relating to the assessment moderation on behalf of the Institute.</ul><h3 id=policy-statement>3. Policy Statement</h3><p>The Institute will ensure that students’ performances are assessed by fair, timely and transparent procedures, based on clearly defined, consistent and equitable criteria. For this purpose, moderation of the assessment will be conducted to ensure the standards are consistently met.<h3 id=assessment-moderation>4. Assessment Moderation</h3><p>To ensure the validity and reliability of assessments, two assessment moderation stages are employed:<ul><li>a. At the assessment design stage (Pre-Assessment Moderation): the main objective of the moderation process at this stage is to ensure the validity and reliability of the assessments. That is, that assessment criteria are validly aligned with the unit learning outcomes and the assessment design can validly measure student performance against the assessment criteria.<li>b. At the marking stage (Post-Assessment Moderation): the main objective of the moderation process at this stage is to ensure that marking is consistent with assessment criteria and assessment standards are applied in a consistent manner.</ul><p>The moderation process should be carried out for all types of assessment items, including mid-semester and final examinations.<h4>4.1 Pre-Assessment Moderation</h4><ul><li>a. A pre-assessment moderation should be carried out for assessment items of several sample units (25% of overall units) within each major.<li>b. The moderation is conducted by an appointed external moderator who may be a qualified academic in his or her respective field, or a member of a professional body, or a professional representative of an industry, who is appointed by the Institute.<li>c. To ensure the objectivity of the outcome, external moderator(s) should be appointed to moderate assessment items for each unit. The external moderator(s) should consist of a moderator from another higher education institute and/or a moderator from a professional body or an industry professional.<li>d. The process should be undertaken and completed before the commencement of the semester to ensure the unit outline is ready for the students to access at the commencement of the semester.<li>e. The moderation process should be carried out whenever there is a substantial revision of the assessment items and/or substantial revision of the unit outline.<li>f. It is the responsibility of the Unit Coordinator to make sure the documents are ready for moderation and to notify the Dean and/or the Course Coordinator once they are ready.<li>g. The documents should consist of assessment item description (instruction, requirement and criteria as well as the rubric) for all assessment items (including mid-semester and final examination) of the nominated units from each major.<li>h. The process should be completed within ten (10) calendar days after the submission of the moderation documents.<li>i. Moderation feedback should include comments on the validity and reliability of the assessment items as well as the recommendation.<li>j. The Course Coordinator will approve the type and weightage of the assessment items.</ul><h4>4.2 Post Assessment Moderation</h4><ul><li>a. A post-assessment moderation should be carried out for each assessment with more than twenty (20) percent of the total assessment of the unit, excluding an assessment which consists of full Multiple-Choice Questions. The moderation is conducted by a unit coordinator or an appointed internal moderator.<li>b. A random sample of papers (from low, medium and high marks) should be submitted for moderation, along with the assessment description and assessment rubrics. In the case of a small class size (less than ten students), three (3) samples, (one from each level) should be submitted for moderation.<li>c. In the case of parallel classes running for the same units, six (6) moderation samples (two from each level) should be taken from each class.<li>d. The process should be completed within fourteen (14) calendar days after the due date of each assessment item.<li>e. It is the responsibility of the lecturer to contact the unit coordinator to arrange for a moderation process. In the case where only unit coordinator teaches the unit, an internal moderator from within the Institute will be appointed by the Dean to carry out the moderation process.<li>f. Moderation feedback should include comments on the marking consistency as well as the recommendation.</ul><h3 id=marking>5. Marking</h3><p>In the marking of assessments, one of the main objectives is to ensure reliability and consistency between different markers. The Unit Coordinator would be able to ensure marking reliability and consistency by:<ul><li>i. Ensuring a marking key and/or solutions guide is available for all markers in all units;<li>ii. Ensuring that markers understand the marking criteria, rubric, marking key or solutions guide. A pre-marking meeting/training will be conducted before the marking exercise commences for any semester;<li>iii. Allocating all assignments to one marker where feasible. Alternatively, allocate one section of an assessment of all students to one marker for marking. This will require a system of rotating submitted assessment work across the marking team;<li>iv. Checking marks of very high and very low scoring assessments in each unit.</ul><p>5.2 Second marking of some assessments may be undertaken. In larger courses, this might involve a random sample being subjected to second (double) marking or blind marking, where markers do not see each other’s comments or grades until after marking is completed. Discrepancy in the grading needs to be considered carefully and resolved. Where markers agree closely, small differences can be resolved by averaging.<p>5.3 The scheduling of an intra-marking moderation meeting or opportunities for a marker to discuss issues with the Unit Coordinator and other markers early in the marking process allows for the detection of any problems/issues in applying the marking criteria and the type and way feedback is provided. It is extremely helpful if the Course Coordinator can identify issues as they arise during marking and resolve them before markers have completed marking to avoid unnecessary workload if marking needs to be readdressed.<h3 id=examinations-moderation>6. Examinations Moderation</h3><ul><li>6.1 Receive and moderate copies of at least five (5) exam papers, ranging from fail, pass, credit, distinction and high distinction from each assessor, within five (5) working days of the date of receipt. If enrolments in a unit are over 50, up to 20% of exams may be moderated, as deemed appropriate by the Course Coordinator. The Course Coordinators should liaise with other assessors to agree on the best means of providing copies of marked exam papers.<li>6.2 Moderate grades and provide feedback to assessors within five (5) working days of the date of receipt of exam papers. The Course Coordinator will provide feedback and advise the assessor directly of any required adjustments to their exam marking. This may necessitate the assessor adjusting previous exam marks awarded to conform to the moderated sample (no marks must be released to students during this period).<li>6.3 Receive a list of all assignment marks from the assessor on completion of marking and within ten (10) working days of the assignment due date.</ul><h3 id=roles-and-responsibilities>7. Assessment-moderation related Roles and Responsibilities</h3><h4>7.1 Dean and/or Course Coordinator</h4><p>The Dean and/or Course coordinator are responsible for the overall assessment moderation process, including appointing external moderators for pre-assessment moderation and, if necessary, internal moderators for post-assessment moderation, as well as monitoring the process.<h4>7.2 Unit Coordinator</h4><p>The Unit Coordinator is a qualified academic in the relevant field who is appointed by the Dean/Relevant Course Coordinator and approved by the Academic Board. The Unit Coordinator is responsible for both pre-assessment and post-assessment moderation.<p>In the pre-assessment moderation process, the unit coordinator is responsible for:<ul><li>a. designing the assessment items and preparing all the documents as described in section 4.1 for pre-assessment moderation process;<li>b. notifying the Dean/Course Coordinator when the documents are ready and monitoring the progress of the moderation process once the external moderators have been appointed;<li>c. responding to the feedback given by the external moderators and, if necessary, revising the assessment items;<li>d. finalising the items and obtaining the Dean/Course Coordinator’s approval before officially publishing the unit outline.</ul><p>In the post-assessment moderation process, the unit coordinator is responsible for:<ul><li>a. informing the lecturers about the moderation process which include the type of moderation samples to be submitted as well as the timeframe of the process;<li>b. providing constructive feedback and recommendations regarding the consistency of the marking;<li>c. publishing the results once the lecturers have addressed the feedback.</ul><p>Note: In the case where no other lecturer, apart from the unit coordinator, teaches the unit, the moderation process should be carried out by an internal moderator appointed by the Dean/Course Coordinator.<h4>7.3 Lecturer</h4><p>A Lecturer is an academic staff on a full-time, part-time, or sessional basis arrangement with responsibility for unit content and assessment item delivery. If a Lecturer is not a unit coordinator, he or she is responsible to ensure that the following items (but not limited to) are undertaken:<ul><li>a. finalise the marking process within two weeks after the due date of each assessment item<li>b. contact the unit coordinator (or the internal moderator, if the class is only taught by a unit coordinator) and send six (6) moderation sample documents – as described in section 4.2 of this policy<li>c. respond to the feedback given by the unit coordinator or internal moderator and, if necessary, adjust the marks<li>d. notify the unit coordinator once the recommendation is addressed, so the marks can be officially published<li>e. if the class is only taught by the unit coordinator, the marks can be published once the recommendation is addressed without having to notify the internal moderator.</ul><h4>7.4 External Moderator</h4><p>An external moderator is appointed to carry out the pre-assessment moderation process, to ensure the validity and reliability of the assessment items. An external moderator is responsible for:<ul><li>i. providing constructive feedback and recommendations on each assessment item in the unit, per the unit learning outcomes as well as the expected standard of knowledge in their respective fields;<li>ii. completing the moderation process within fourteen (14) calendar days of the submission of the assessment item papers.</ul><h4>7.5 Internal Moderator</h4><p>An internal moderator is appointed to carry out a post-assessment moderation where the unit coordinator is the only one teaching the unit. An internal moderator is responsible for:<ul><li>i. providing constructive feedback and recommendations per the assessment requirement and criteria;<li>ii. completing the moderation process within one week of the submission of the sample papers.</ul><h3 id=quality-assurances>8. Quality Assurances</h3><ul><li>8.1 To ensure the quality of the assessment, the moderation process will apply to all units listed in the course structure.<li>8.2 The moderation process should be carried out for all new unit outlines as well as when there is a substantial revision to the existing unit outlines/assessment items.<li>8.3 In the case where there is no substantial revision to the unit outline and/or the assessment item, a regular two (2) year review should be implemented to ensure the content of the unit outline and/or the assessment item is relevant to current industry trends.<li>8.4 At least one fifth of the unit assessment items are externally reviewed. The Dean will ensure that all unit outlines/assessment items are externally reviewed at least every five (5) years.</ul><h3 id=records-management>9. Records Management</h3><ul><li>9.1 All items submitted or completed by a student for the purpose of assessment or evaluation, in the course, will be submitted and stored in electronic format for a period of six (6) months following the end of the students’ enrolled period with the Institute, except for final exam papers, which will be retained in their original format as per 9.2. At the end of the retention period, the items will be destroyed.<li>9.2 The Institute will retain final exam papers (physical copy) for all units for one semester after which the items will be destroyed.<li>9.3 The Institute will collect samples of all assessed work in all units and save these to a secure account or arrange for regular moderation feedback reports, to facilitate an annual report summary and review of the assessments by the relevant academic staff. The feedback reports will be reviewed at Academic Board and Course and Industry Advisory Committee meetings and the relevant Course Coordinator(s) will discuss the feedback with the lecturer and ensure appropriate adjustments to marking standards/moderation are undertaken where required. Following this review and feedback by the academic staff such records will be archived.</ul>",

Purpose</h3><p>The International Student Transfer Policy and Procedure (‘the Policy’) outlines the circumstances under which Churchill Institute of Higher Education (“the Institute”) will consider the application of a student for transfer to/from the Institute to/from another registered provider before completing 6 months of their principal course of study and to ensure that the Institute complies with the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 with regard to restriction on international student transfer.<h3 id=definitions>2. Definitions</h3><p>For definitions, refer to the Dictionary of Terms.<h3 id=scope>3. Scope</h3><p>This Policy applies to all prospective and enrolled international students of the Institute and relevant staff. It should be noted that the procedures outlined in this Policy do not substitute or alter procedures or other duties that may occur under other policies or statutes or any other legislation. This Policy should be read in conjunction with other related policies.<h3 id=policy-statement>4. Policy Statement</h3><ul><li>4.1 The Institute is dedicated to the well-being of its students and to ensuring that all students receive adequate support and to facilitating the transition to life and study in Australia.<li>4.2 The Institute encourages all students to closely read this Policy when considering applying for transfer from or to another registered provider.<li>4.3 There is no cost of issuing a Letter of Release to the students.</ul><h3 id=policy-details>5. Policy Details</h3><ul><li>5.1 This section relates to students who seek to transfer from another registered provider to the Institute. The only circumstances in which a student may be approved for enrolment at the Institute before finishing 6 months of their main course of study with another registered provider are when one of the following applies:<ul><li>5.1.1 the initial registered provider has authorised release on PRISMS; or<li>5.1.2 the initial registered provider has been sanctioned by the government for its registration, which prohibits the student from continuing their main course of study at that institute; or<li>5.1.3 the student's government sponsor believes that the change is in the best interest of the student and has provided written support for the change; or<li>5.1.4 the original registered provider is no longer registered, or the course in which the student is enrolled has ceased to be registered.</ul><li>Note that international students wishing to transfer to the Institute must comply with the Student Admissions Policy and Procedure of the Institute and satisfy the criteria for admission to the course in all conditions.<li>5.2 This section relates to students who seek to transfer to another registered provider from the Institute. The following factors will be taken into consideration when making an assessment:<ul><li>5.2.1 whether the student requesting a transfer has a clear knowledge of what the transfer represents for their study options;<li>5.2.2 whether the student has discussed with the Dean the reasons for seeking a transfer;<li>5.2.3 whether the student seeks to transfer to another registered provider solely to prevent reporting to the Department of Education and Training (DET) or the Department of Home Affairs for failure to satisfy the demands of academic advancement;<li>5.2.4 whether the student has outstanding tuition fees due to the Institute.</ul><li>5.3 The Institute will grant an international student request for transfer prior to completing six months of their principal course when it is considered circumstances exist that suggest the transfer is in the student’s best interest. Such circumstances include (but are not limited to):<ul><li>5.3.1 the overseas student will be reported because they are unable to achieve satisfactory course progress at the level they are studying, even after engaging with the Institute’s intervention strategy to assist students;<li>5.3.2 evidence of compassionate or compelling circumstances;<li>5.3.3 the Institute fails to deliver the course as outlined in the written agreement;<li>5.3.4 evidence that the overseas student’s reasonable expectations about their current course are not being met;<li>5.3.5 evidence that the overseas student was misled by the Institute or an education or migration agent regarding the Institute or its course, and the course is therefore unsuitable to the student’s needs and/or study objectives;<li>5.3.6 an appeal (internal or external) on another matter results in a decision or recommendation to release the overseas student.</ul></ul><h3 id=procedure-details>6. Procedure</h3><ul><li>6.1 Students who seek to transfer from another registered provider to the Institute.<ul><li>6.1.1 The Institute receives a request from an onshore student who is currently studying at another registered provider.<li>6.1.2 Using the student's passport information, including their student visa and the date the student arrived in Australia, the Institute will determine whether the student has completed 6 months of their main study course with the other registered provider.<li>6.1.3 If the student has completed 6 months study in their principal course of study, the application process proceeds as for all other onshore international student applications.<li>6.1.4 If the student has not completed 6 months study in their principal course of study, they are required to provide a Letter of Release from the registered provider of the principal course. The Institute will provide the student with a “conditional” Letter of Offer which clearly states that an offer of a place is contingent on their obtaining a Letter of Release from the registered provider that they are currently studying with.<li>6.1.5 If the student is a government sponsored student, they are required to provide written support from their sponsor agreeing to the change which will stand in lieu of a Letter of Release.<li>6.1.6 Once a Letter of Release is received by the Institute, the application proceeds as for all other onshore international student applications.<li>6.1.7 If a Letter of Release is not provided by the student, the application process will be placed on hold and the student notified that at this moment they are unable to transfer. The student will be encouraged to re-activate their request after completing their main course of study for 6 months.<li>6.1.8 In the conditions where the initial institution or course has stopped being registered or the Australian government has imposed sanctions on the initial institution that do not allow the student to continue the course, no release letter is needed.</ul><li>6.2 Students who seek to transfer to another registered provider from the Institute.<ul><li>6.2.1 The international student will present, in person, to the Institute and provide the Course Withdrawal Form. An exit interview will be arranged by the Student Support Officer with the Dean or nominee where the student will provide an initial copy of a valid offer letter from the registered provider to which the student wants to transfer.<li>6.2.2 If the transfer application is successful, the student would be required to complete an Exit Checklist that includes clearance from the Librarian & Information Service Manager and Accounts Officer/Manager.

Aim of Orientation</h4><p>The Churchill Institute of Higher Education’s (‘the Institute’) orientation program will facilitate a smooth and successful transition into a degree for commencing students. Orientation activities and resources will be available in a timely manner and will be accessible, relevant and accurate regardless of students’ educational background, geographical location or study mode. The Institution’s orientation program will inspire students to fully engage with their learning experience and will address the mutual expectations and needs of students and the Institute for students to become successful and independent learners.<h4>2. Student Experience</h4><p>The Institute is committed to creating a unified, integrated, student-centred experience by improving the quality of our students’ engagement with the Institute regardless of who they are, where they are, or what stage they are in their relationship with the Institute. An orientation process that supports a successful transition into a degree is central to a quality student experience.<h4>3. Learning Transitions</h4><p>All students regardless of their age, educational background, location or study mode experience a period of transition or adjustment when commencing study. Transition is commonly associated with school leavers commencing at the Institute whether domestic or international students.<p>Orientation programs and activities have an important role to play in ensuring these transitions are as smooth as possible. The Institute recognises that the transition process is one which is mediated over time, and planning and delivery of orientation activities and strategies reflects this. The ‘official’ orientation period extends from the time of the ‘letter of offer’ through until the end of the first session of study and includes strategies embedded within and outside the course.<h4>4. Roles and Responsibilities</h4><h5>4.1 Overarching Governance</h5><p>The Executive Management Team is responsible for the general oversight of orientation at the Institute. For terms of reference, refer to the Institute’s Governance Charter for further details.<h5>4.2 Student Association</h5><p>The Student Association is responsible for the organisation of social activities for students during the orientation period. It is expected that opportunities for social interaction will also be organised through course specialisation-based events.<h5>4.3 Course and Unit Coordinators</h5><p>The Course and Unit Coordinators are responsible for ensuring that the transition needs of students in their course are met through the orientation process and for providing necessary information. At a minimum, course-based orientation should:<ul><li>a. Provide an overview of the course.<li>b. Outline academic expectations for course/unit(s) in terms of time commitments, assessments, attendance.<li>c. Provide opportunity for students to clarify their expectations and ask questions.<li>d. Emphasise the availability of support services.<li>e. Provide opportunities for the development of student-student and student-staff relationships.</ul><p>Course and Unit Coordinators are also responsible for ensuring that the first-year curriculum actively supports student progression.<h5>4.4 The Academic Manager</h5><p>The Academic Manager is responsible for the overall coordination of orientation activities including timetabling of activities, liaising between key stakeholders, dissemination of orientation guidelines and the ongoing evaluation and reporting of orientation activities across the Institute ensuring equivalence of service, information and quality regardless of location.<h5>4.5 The Dean</h5><p>The Dean, along with the Academic Manager, is responsible for the general oversight of on-campus orientation activities and the organisation of a commencement ceremony in Semester 1 each year. This ceremony should be a welcome to the Institute to new students and their families and should be a positive and motivating occasion that inspires students to strive for success and instils confidence in families that the Institute has been the right choice.<h5>4.6 The reception</h5><p>The reception is the single point of contact for student queries during the orientation process. The Academic staff must provide the admin team with copies of all information; timetables and resources provided to students and should be made aware of any special information requirements or advice to be provided to students.<h4>5. Operational guidelines</h4><h5>5.1 Key Dates and Activities</h5><p>The week immediately preceding Week 1 of the semester is known as ‘O-week’ and is the period where activities on campus and online concentrate on the following issues:<ul><li>a. Ensuring enrolment is accurate and complete;<li>b. Making on campus and online tours available;<li>c. Providing activities to facilitate peer to peer /peer to staff engagement within the course;<li>d. Academic expectations are outlined; and<li>e. Students are made aware of support services available at the Institute.</ul><p>‘O Week’ activities for international students shall be aligned with relevant dates suitable for their arrival. While activities will be focused on specific dates aligning to the academic calendar, the Institute is mindful that students may enrol before or after the official starting point of session. For this reason, transition-based resources will be available on an ongoing basis.<h5>5.2 O–Week</h5><ul><li>a. O–Week will begin with a commencement ceremony and should be addressed by the most senior member of academic staff available including the Chairs of the respective Governing Bodies.<li>b. Organisers should consult with the Marketing Team to ensure appropriate use of the Institute’s branding banners and other relevant materials and promotion.</ul><p>Where possible face-to-face delivered orientation sessions/lectures should be recorded/saved to the orientation site to be available for those who couldn’t attend and to develop a repository of sustainable resources.",

Preamble</h2><h3>1.1 Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of this Policy is to outline the Churchill Institute of Higher Education (‘the Institute’) commitment to design and deliver assessment items that facilitates achieving and accurately measuring the specific learning outcomes of a unit/course including facilitating the management of assessment items and related activities to ensure the students consistently achieve learning outcomes consistent with the level of qualifications of their course of study.<h3>1.2 Background</h3><p>Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning and significantly influences what and how students learn and the measurement of student performance against course learning outcomes. Assessments are developed and measured to ensure the students learning process achieves expected learning outcomes.<p>This Policy has been structured to meet the requirements of the Institute’s policies, quality assurance standards, accreditation requirements and relevant administrative standards.<h3>1.3 Principles</h3><p>In keeping with the Australian Quality Framework, assessment at the Institute will be designed to accurately measure unit and course learning outcomes, defined as the set of knowledge and skills a student must acquire to demonstrate learning at the appropriate level of qualification.<p>To this effect:<ul><li>a. Assessments must provide reliable indicators of student learning and achievement against learning outcomes and must be appropriately weighted to reflect the demands placed on the student.<li>b. Assessment will serve summative and formative purposes. Respectively, measuring student attainment of unit and course learning outcomes, as well as developing knowledge and skills as part of the student learning process throughout their course of study.<li>c. Assessment design and marking criteria statements must provide clear and concise directions to students undertaking assessment, as well as the Institute’s staff, who may be tasked with moderation, review and/or quality assurance of assessment.<li>d. Assessment grading must be undertaken against pre-advised and clearly articulated criteria, followed, where appropriate, by formative feedback on learning against stated performance criteria to support and stimulate student progression towards learning outcomes.<li>e. Assessment methods will be diverse over the course of study, cognizant of diverse student learning needs and styles, and to authentically prepare students for employment in diverse organisational settings.</ul><h3>1.4 Definitions</h3><p>For definitions, refer to Dictionary of Terms.<h2>2. Scope</h2><p>This Policy provides information about the Institute’s assessment policies and requirements for all assessments of units offered at the Institute. Furthermore, this Policy applies to:<ul><li>2.1 assessment of unit-work by students undertaking undergraduate award degrees at the Institute;<li>2.2 academic and administrative staff, students and people contracted by the Institute with responsibility for designing, administering and making decisions relating to assessments on behalf of the Institute.</ul><h2>3. Policy Statement</h2><p>The Institute will ensure that students’ performances are assessed by fair, timely and transparent procedures, based on clearly defined, consistent and equitable criteria aligned with course and unit learning outcome goals.<h2>4. Assessment</h2><h3>4.1 Assessment Design</h3><p>The assessment design gives a clear guidance to examiners of the expectations and requirements of assessments at the appropriate Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level. Assessments will be designed under the following guide and will:<ul><li>4.1.1 be disciplined-based and relate to any discipline’s accreditation requirement and AQF level to explicitly enable students to demonstrate achievement of the specified learning outcome for the unit;<li>4.1.2 use a variety of tasks to measure different learning outcomes as specified in the unit outline;<li>4.1.3 challenge students to deeper learning and provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their full capacity;<li>4.1.4 use valid criteria and standards to differentiate students’ level of achievements;<li>4.1.5 consist of a minimum of two (2) items of assessment and a maximum of four (4) items of assessment for each unit with a minimum value of 10% per assessment item and a total of 100% for each unit;<li>4.1.6 The Academic Board has the authority to determine the percentage of overall assessment allocated to exam assessments and the number of exams assessment that can be used on a unit.;<li>4.1.7 Unless otherwise approved by the Academic Board no final exam can be no more than 40 percent.</ul><h3>4.2 Assessment Items</h3><ul><li>4.2.1 Assessment items may take a variety of forms, which might vary across units as well as across course stages (first year, second year and third year units).<li>4.2.2 The assessment can be designed as written assessments (essay, report and/or case study analysis) as well as in-class assessments (quiz, presentation, demonstration and/or examination). Each item of the assessment will be allocated a minimum of ten (10) percent value from the total assessments for the unit with a total of one hundred (100) percent value for each unit. Assessments can be individual as well as group based.<li>4.2.3 The unit developer will develop and write all the assessment items and the unit learning outcomes.<li>4.2.4 The Course Coordinator will approve the type, weight and duration of the assessment items.</ul><h3>4.3 Assessment Guide</h3><p>Assessment items for each unit will be listed in the Unit Outline and include the weighting of an assessment item and the percentage contribution to the overall grade of the total assessment. The submission date for each assessment item will also be specified.<p>A separate document consisting of assessment information will be provided for each assessment item and will include the assessment objective, detailed description and expectation, submission date as well as assessment marking rubrics.<p>The unit outline and assessment information will be made available via the Institute’s Learning Portal to the students one week prior to the commencement of the semester.<h3>4.4 Assessment Submission</h3><p>Students must attempt all assessments on time as scheduled in the unit outline; the submission date for written assessment will be expressed in semester week number as well as a specified day, date and cut off time.<p>All written assessments will be submitted through ‘Turnitin’ for text matching via the Institute’s Learning Portal. In the instance where the lecturers requested a hard copy of the assessment, it could be handed directly to the lecturers in the nominated class time or via an assessment drop box which will be set up at Reception.<h3>4.5 Late Assessment Policy for Written Submissions</h3><p>To ensure that the requirement of assessments to be assessed is fair, transparent and equitable, penalties will be consistently applied.<p>An assessment submitted after the due date without proper approval, will be considered as a late submission. A mark equivalent to ten (10) percent of the total allocated for the assessment will be deducted from the marked value for every day the assessment is late. An assessment more than seven (7) calendar days overdue will not be marked and will receive a zero mark unless misadventure is substantiated.<h3>4.6 Late Assessment Policy for In-class Assessments</h3><p>With regards to in-class assessments (quiz, test, presentation), in the case of an unexcused absence from the assessment, a student will receive a zero mark and/or may be given an Incomplete (IN) grade for the unit. An excused absence warrants an opportunity for a deferment or a supplementary assessment.<h3>4.7 Extension of Submission (written and in-class assessment)</h3><p>Where a student cannot submit the assessment on time due to illness or misadventure, the request to extend the submission will be made formally by completing the Request for Assessment Extension form, at least one (1) day before the submission date and must be accompanied by supporting documents.<p>A request made on the submission day will not be considered.<p>The specific circumstance conditions which could be considered for submission extensions are:<ul><li>4.7.1 Genuine Illness: a medical certificate is compulsory and must be obtained from a registered medical doctor and the certificate must explain the nature of the condition suffered by the students and the period during which condition affected the students’ performance.<li>4.7.2 Illness over Extended Period: a medical report should be attached along with a medical certificate and must specify the nature of the condition suffered by the student and the period during which the condition affected the student’s performance.<li>4.7.3 Genuine Misadventure: in the case of misadventure (personal/family crisis and/or accident) a testimonial must be submitted as soon as the student returns from absence or prior to the absence and the students might be requested to attend an interview to ascertain the veracity of their claims.</ul><h3>4.8 Supplementary and Deferred Assessment</h3><ul><li>4.8.1 Supplementary and Deferred Assessment will only be granted in specific circumstances.<li>4.8.2 Students will be advised on the outcome of their application within seven (7) working days and a new submission date set with the approval of the relevant Unit Coordinator or Course Coordinator.<li>4.8.3 Students must score forty (40) percent in the final exam to pass the unit. If a student has fifty (50) percent or higher mark in a unit but has not scored forty (40) percent or higher in the final exam, the student’s result will not be considered as pass. In that situation, the student will be eligible for a supplementary exam. An admin fee of $250 will be charged per unit for a student to sit a supplementary exam.</ul><h2>5. Rationale for Assessments</h2><p>All units will include student assessments. The rationale for assessment is:<ul><li>5.1 to promote, enhance, and improve the quality of student learning through feedback that is clear, informative, timely, constructive and relevant to the needs of the student,<li>5.2 to measure and confirm the standard of student performance and achievement in relation to a unit’s defined learning outcomes,<li>5.3 to reward student effort and achievement with an appropriate grade, and<li>5.4 to provide relevant information to evaluate continuously and improve the quality of the curriculum and the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process.</ul><h2>6. Forms of Assessment</h2><p>Normally, assessment of a unit of study will involve several different forms of assessment.<ul><li>6.1 The form of assessment in a unit must be appropriate to reliably and authentically assess stated learning outcomes.<li>6.2 The use of a variety of forms of assessment is encouraged to accommodate learner diversity, as the use of different assessment methods will provide for a fairer assessment of diverse student’s capabilities.<li>6.3 Continual assessment can serve both summative and formative purposes within units and across the course. That is, continual assessment items will be designed to build on each other, so that learning during each can be used to improve performance in subsequent assessments and develop student knowledge and skills towards unit and course learning outcomes.<li>6.4 Where assessment is formative, feedback on assessment must provide students with improvement focused guidance related to the pre-advised marking criteria.<li>6.5 Summative assessment of student attainment of course learning outcomes will be scaffolded and mapped throughout the course of study and the lecturer must be aware of where their unit aligns with the mapping of student learning across the course.</ul><h2>7. Notification to students of assessment requirements</h2><p>A fundamental aspect of developing a unit is the specification of the prescribed assessment tasks in a way that relates them directly to the unit’s objectives (including expected learning outcomes), the course structure, the teaching methods to be used, and the learning strategies to be fostered. Lecturers will ensure that students are fully informed, in writing, in the introductory session of a unit, about unit objectives and expectations, including the assessment requirements and submission dates.
