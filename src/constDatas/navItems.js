          <h2>Preamble</h2>
          <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of this Policy is to clearly state the Churchill Institute
            of Higher Education's (â€˜the Institute') Policy on academic integrity
            which applies to its students. This Policy document must be read in
            conjunction with the Student Code of Conduct.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Background</h3>
          <p>
            Academic integrity and honesty are fundamental principles of any
            educational institute devoted to the pursuit of excellence in teaching
            and learning. The Institute is committed to maintaining the highest
            academic standards and will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Instill in students the importance of independent thought, carrying
              out their own research and knowing how to acknowledge the work of
              others;
            </li>
            <li>
              Require and expect students to undertake their academic work honestly
              and to conduct themselves in a manner which is and consistent with the
              principles of academic integrity;
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a range of approaches to raise awareness by students about the
              critical importance of academic integrity and to educate students to
              practice academic honesty in the creation, development, and
              application of their work;
            </li>
            <li>
              Act in a consistent and equitable manner to access and manage any
              academic misconduct by students.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>3. Definitions</h3>
          <p>For definitions, refer to the Dictionary of Terms.</p>
    
          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>
            This Policy applies to all students enrolled in the Institute in
            relation to the creation, development, and application of all academic
            assessments.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
          <p>
            The Institute will ensure that academic integrity is managed by fair,
            timely and transparent procedures, based on clearly defined, consistent
            and equitable criteria. Failure to maintain academic integrity will be
            dealt with seriously and appropriate action taken.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Preventative Measure</h2>
          <p>
            The Institute adopts preventative strategies that mitigate the risk of
            academic misconduct which applies equally to all students and staff of
            the Institute. Academic Integrity is promoted at orientation and within
            the classroom by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conducting 'Academic Integrity Workshops' - the Librarian and Learning
              Support Manager will conduct such workshops at least 6 times during
              each teaching term;
            </li>
            <li>Role modelling academic integrity to students;</li>
            <li>
              Clearly communicating assessment/examination requirements to students;
            </li>
            <li>
              Encouraging students to make every effort to avoid academic misconduct
              by taking responsibility for understanding what constitutes academic
              misconduct and assessment/examination requirements through attendance
              of the workshop involved.
            </li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2>Elements of Academic Integrity</h2>
          <p>
            Academic misconduct/misdemeanour at the Institute is inclusive but not
            limited to the following, students must not intend to deceive under any
            assessment tasks.
          </p>
          <h3>5.1 Cheating in Examination</h3>
          <p>In attempting any examination, the student(s) must not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read, copy from, or otherwise using another student's work during an
              exam or knowingly allow another student to do so;
            </li>
            <li>
              Acquire, attempt, possess, or distribute examination materials or
              information without any pre-approval;
            </li>
            <li>
              Accept assistance from any person/source who is not an examination
              supervisor whilst in the examination room;
            </li>
            <li>
              Consult with another source outside the examination room during the
              examination process;
            </li>
            <li>
              Impersonate another source or procure impersonation in attempting the
              examination.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>5.2 Plagiarism</h3>
          <p>
            Plagiarism occurs when the student(s) present their thoughts, ideas, or
            work of another source without proper acknowledgement of the author or
            the source. Students must not:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Partly or significantly copy ideas, concepts, text, data, and
              information from another source and present it as his or her own work;
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct content which is drawn from any source without attribution
              of the source;
            </li>
            <li>
              Summarise another person's work without acknowledgement of the source;
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit substantially the same final version of any material as another
              student.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Therefore, in presenting a written assignment, the students should make
            it clear when a direct quotation is used, and in the case of using
            resources to build an argument, an acknowledgement of the resources
            should be made by using the appropriate method of referencing.
          </p>
          <h3>5.3 Collusion</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of assessment, in which individually assessable work is
            required to be submitted, the formulation of ideas must be the
            independent work of each student. Therefore, the student must not:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Undertake unauthorised collaboration in which students work together
              to produce an identical assessment, either in part or in whole;
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage or assist another person to commit collusion by allowing the
              person to copy their work for completing an assessment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>5.4 Recycling assignment</h3>
          <p>
            The Institute expects students not to submit an assessment that is an
            identical or a substantially similar assessment for another or
            previously submitted unit. The Institute understands that academic work
            within a discipline could be interrelated and expects students, when
            transcribing content for use in similar topics, to enhance and refine
            the content of an assignment as they progress through their degree. It
            is not acceptable to resubmit the exact copy of work previously
            submitted without enhancing or refining the concepts contained in the
            assignment.
          </p>
          <h3>5.5 Contract Cheating</h3>
          <p>Students must not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contract a third party for a fee or another benefit (e.g., free of
              cost) to complete part or all the assessment on behalf of the student;
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit part or all the assessment as his or her own when it was
              completed by a third party.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>5.6 Misrepresentation or Fabrication of Data</h3>
          <p>Students must not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fabricate or falsify data and then present it as legitimate data in an
              assessment.
            </li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2>Identifying and Detecting Academic Misconduct</h2>
          <p>Academic misconduct may be identified by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plagiarism detection software;</li>
            <li>
              Unit Coordinator/Marker/Tutor or Examination invigilator/Marker;
            </li>
            <li>Report from another student.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2>Whistleblowers - Breach and Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Where a breach of academic integrity is reported, the person reporting
            the breach (whistleblower) will be protected from any backlash and
            treated with sensitivity and respect. The whistleblower will be expected
            to act honestly and make the report in good faith. If the report is
            found to be made with malicious intent, appropriate action may be taken
            against the whistleblower. The Institute will ensure that the
            whistleblower's identity is kept confidential unless disclosure is
            required by law or necessary to ensure a fair process. Whistleblowers
            can report breaches through the designated channels provided by the
            Institute.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Level of Academic Misconduct</h2>
          <p>
            The level of academic misconduct will be classified as either minor or
            major depending on the severity and frequency of the misconduct.
          </p>
          <h3>8.1 Minor Misconduct</h3>
          <p>Minor misconduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unintentional failure to acknowledge sources;</li>
            <li>First-time offense;</li>
            <li>Small portion of work affected.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Minor misconduct may result in penalties such as a warning, reduced
            marks, or requirement to resubmit the work with proper acknowledgment.
          </p>
          <h3>8.2 Major Misconduct</h3>
          <p>Major misconduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Intentional plagiarism;</li>
            <li>Repeated offenses;</li>
            <li>Large portion of work affected;</li>
            <li>Cheating in examinations;</li>
            <li>Contract cheating;</li>
            <li>Fabrication or falsification of data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Major misconduct may result in more severe penalties such as failing the
            unit, suspension, or expulsion from the Institute.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Penalties</h2>
          <p>
            The penalties for academic misconduct will be applied based on the level
            of misconduct and may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Warning;</li>
            <li>Reduced marks;</li>
            <li>Requirement to resubmit work;</li>

            Penalties will be determined by the Academic Integrity Committee in
            consultation with the relevant academic staff.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Misconduct in Examinations</h2>

            Specific procedures are in place to address misconduct in examinations,
            including the confiscation of unauthorized materials, removal from the
            examination room, and further investigation by the Academic Integrity
            Committee.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Appeals</h2>
          <p>
            Students have the right to appeal decisions related to academic
            misconduct. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Academic
            Integrity Committee within a specified time frame, typically within 10
            working days of the decision. The appeal process will be fair and
            transparent, providing the student with an opportunity to present their
            case.
